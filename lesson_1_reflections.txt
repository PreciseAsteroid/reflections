++ How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it highlighted the changes very nicely and helped me to focus on what was changed.
since we new it worked before, the cause for the bug must had to come from the differences between these two versions,

++ How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

it will help me split the work into granular enough pieces. not too big, not too small.

++ What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: no automation could slice the code to the right pieces
cons: forgetting to save

++Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

that is b/c with code the logical changes are applied to different files at once. like adding a button that'd
impact the html, js and css file.

++How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

it is like a safety net to make changes. I can always go back to safety

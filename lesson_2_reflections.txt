++What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git folder is created with an empty repository and no commits.
no files are added to it in order give us a chance to add description to the commit

++How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by running git diff --staged I can check the difference between the repo
and the staging area. I should make sure that only changes that relate to the
same logical change are there.
